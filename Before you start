This course is for beginner who wants to learn a commputer programing. As a computer language, we will study C++.
So I do not assume you know any kind of programming experiences.
If you already had a lot of programming expiences, please contact me after class.
But, I will assume you understand how to use computers like turning it on and off, installing or uninstalling programs, using web browser and checking email regularly.
Mac or PC, it does not matter.

I require the following things to you.

   1. Spend At least 10 hours per week on programming practices.
   2. Do not copy projects and tests form others. (!!!!)
   3. Attend the class on time.

I want to warn you again.

Many students feel easy for the first month, since I only cover the beginning of programming.
If you do not practice a lot by yourself, you cannot catch later and will fail.
I will guaranttee.

If you cannot still decide whether this course is for you or not, please read my syllabus and check the projects.
